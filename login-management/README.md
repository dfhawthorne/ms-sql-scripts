# Login Management

## create-login-script.sql

This script is based on "[Transfer logins and passwords between instances of SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/sql/security/transfer-logins-passwords-between-instances)".

The enhancements are:
* Ignore standard MS-SQL/Server logins
* Subset of default databases
